# APOD Explorer App (apod-android)
Android App for exploring NASA's "Astronomy Picture of the Day" API. A learning exercise and fun project for me.

# Architecture
  - Following [Android Architecture Recommendations](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/recommendations)

### üñºÔ∏è UI
      
The app contains a simple Compose UI that shows:
 - A list of random images returned from [NASA's APOD API](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api)
with title and dates that they were the APOD.
   - The list is sortable by Title or Date, changed via Floating Action Button.
   - The list can be refreshed using pull-to-refresh to get a new random list from the API.
